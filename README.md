### Formal Qualities

This piece allows participants to interact with a “creature”. The latter is shown on a large display, and participants can scan a QR code to make their phones input devices to interact with it. They have to explore to find which gestures affect the “creature” and how. When they successfully interact with the creature, participants get feedback on their phones as well as the main display. Each gesture has a unique visual feedback associated.

### Context

I wanted to reflect on the concepts of individual contributions to a greater cause and collaboration in a group setting.
Individual contributions: 
Oftentimes, when asked to do a very small gesture towards a great cause (like donating a few cents to a charity) we feel like whether we, as individuals, make the donation or not, not much will change. I sadly often find myself thinking this, though it’s an erroneous mindset to have: if everyone thinks that same way, no change will ever happen. This piece showcases at a small scale that when small contributions are put together, an impact can actually be made. I intentionally made it difficult for a small number of people to keep the creature at a stable state to incite participants to recruit help.
Collaboration:
In the same vein, for an impact to be made, there must be communication between the contributing members. In certain cases, different kinds of contributions are needed from  different people. Therefore, to make sure all needs are met, people must communicate. To replicate this at the small scale, this piece calls participants to communicate and divide the tasks among themselves to satisfy the creature’s 3 needs.
